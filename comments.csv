31 |Okay bear with me for a sec. So AI bots are typically trained over many &quot;generations,&quot; through which they learn how to be more coherent and develop a better understanding of how things work. Kind of like how each generation of humans learns more about our reality.<br><br>Now this AI has reached a point where it was able to invent some genuinely funny jokes, even though it still seems to have a misguided understanding of various words and the structure of reality.<br><br>So whether you believe in God or a simulation or whatever, what if we as a species are just a project that&#39;s learning over many generations in order to provide entertainment or insight to some other entity? Just like this AI making up an absurd stand-up routine, maybe we&#39;re just here to be our flawed, confused, playful selves, and do cool shit for the amusement of reality itself.| 0 0

18 |I’m a bit skeptical that this was AI; it sounds more like a human impression of AI text generation. The ways in which it is good and bad are all backwards. The grammar is constantly off, which really isn’t an issue nowadays. AI generation usually results in perfectly grammatical sentences; they just don’t make semantic sense. There are also a ton of callback jokes, and AI text generation is notoriously bad at maintaining context over time. Each sentence naturally would lead into the next, but overall structure is often nonsensical, because it doesn’t maintain meaning or action-consequence. I really find it hard to believe that it would change topic, but then later come back to the certificate and flag jokes to make a callback.| 0 0

1 |I hope the people saying this is fake are wrong. My experience using ai dungeon makes me think it&#39;s definitely possible that an ai wrote this, because it sometimes spits out jokes like this and sometimes references things mentioned earlier, but it&#39;s also possible it is faked, but faking this sort of thing is just stupid. It stops being a good video if it is faked. I don&#39;t like this and I&#39;m not amused by it if it is written by a human who is lying about writing it.| 0 0

84 |Calm down guys, they are just bad jokes. You could probably find them in an old 1950s joke book. But yes they are funny if your humor is broken to relate to a group of AI.

If you view this as a parody, I&#39;d like to think that its a commentary on how simple minded comedy is to human convenient which is true and appreciate the effort.| 0 0

67 |It makes it so much less funny when it becomes glaringly obvious that it was not actually an AI that wrote this. First, these type of neural networks are not taught with video feed like Netflix claims, they get raw stage directions fed to them as input in text form. Second, there&#39;s just too much cohesion between the parts. A real script output from an actual neural network would not be so self-referential - running jokes, like the death certificate one. Or even mentioning dentists more than once. Third, an AI doesn&#39;t just drop &quot;a&quot; and &quot;the&quot; articles before nouns for seemingly no reasons other than to make it sound funnier for us.

20 |I&#39;m not an AI expert or anything, but I know enough that I was able to cobble together a fanfiction-writing bot. And I can assure anyone reading this that if a bot really did &quot;write&quot; this set it was heavily edited by a human being to make anything resembling a stand-up routine - likely out of hundreds or thousands of pages of essentially drivel.  <br><br>Most of the sentences my bot crafted were correctly structured. Occasionally a small group of sentences would cluster around one concept. And it definitely produced some real gems. But there was A LOT of noise surrounding those gems. My goal was to use the stories as a premise for a podcast.  But to pull together a five minute short story even remotely worth listening to would have taken me heavily editing down hundreds of pages to just a few. And that just didn&#39;t feel right to me.<br><br>I think it&#39;s a real shame and super dishonest when people say a bot &quot;wrote something&quot; when the finished product is actually the result of an extraordinary amount of effort by human editors. That would be like saying Merriam Webster wrote Eat, Pray, Love because all of the words in it came out of the dictionary and Elizabeth Gilbert just edited the story to help give it a better structure.  It gives people an incredibly inaccurate picture of what machine learning is capable of. <br><br>There are some things that modern AIs have gotten very, very good at. Like keeping eyes glued to a news feed or serving you the right ad at the right time. But these writing AIs work simply by predicting what the next word should be by looking at what word or words preceded it. Narrative and/or joke structures simply don&#39;t arise out an algorithm like that. Maybe some day someone will figure out how to get a bot to understand Dan Harmon&#39;s story wheel. But that day is still probably very far off in the future.| 0 0

Kinda.” Or people just find humor that appears to be randomly generated funny. I know I do.| 0 0

Basically go watch any real comedian and compare the two. 100 out of 100 people will laugh harder with the human comedian. This algorithm stand up is terrible. I mean most of the jokes weren&#39;t even proper English. Whoever approved that at Netflix and released it should be fired. Maybe Netflix should next time use the money they invested in this for something useful like feeding homeless or creating a non profit. But that makes too much sense!! Have a great day everyone! Life ROCKS if you want it to!! <br><br>Go watch this Best of Joy Koy.... You&#39;re welcome!<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/J9k0x1JsQ-U">https://youtu.be/J9k0x1JsQ-U</a>| 0 0

818 |I’m a bit skeptical that this was AI; it sounds more like a human impression of AI text generation. The ways in which it is good and bad are all backwards. The grammar is constantly off, which really isn’t an issue nowadays. AI generation usually results in perfectly grammatical sentences; they just don’t make semantic sense. There are also a ton of callback jokes, and AI text generation is notoriously bad at maintaining context over time. Each sentence naturally would lead into the next, but overall structure is often nonsensical, because it doesn’t maintain meaning or action-consequence. I really find it hard to believe that it would change topic, but then later come back to the certificate and flag jokes to make a callback.| 0 0

2684 |Calm down guys, they are just bad jokes. You could probably find them in an old 1950s joke book. But yes they are funny if your humor is broken to relate to a group of AI.

Second, there&#39;s just too much cohesion between the parts. A real script output from an actual neural network would not be so self-referential - running jokes, like the death certificate one. Or even mentioning dentists more than once. Third, an AI doesn&#39;t just drop &quot;a&quot; and &quot;the&quot; articles before nouns for seemingly no reasons other than to make it sound funnier for us.

2920 |I&#39;m not an AI expert or anything, but I know enough that I was able to cobble together a fanfiction-writing bot. And I can assure anyone reading this that if a bot really did &quot;write&quot; this set it was heavily edited by a human being to make anything resembling a stand-up routine - likely out of hundreds or thousands of pages of essentially drivel.  <br><br>Most of the sentences my bot crafted were correctly structured. Occasionally a small group of sentences would cluster around one concept. And it definitely produced some real gems. But there was A LOT of noise surrounding those gems. My goal was to use the stories as a premise for a podcast.  But to pull together a five minute short story even remotely worth listening to would have taken me heavily editing down hundreds of pages to just a few. And that just didn&#39;t feel right to me.<br><br>I think it&#39;s a real shame and super dishonest when people say a bot &quot;wrote something&quot; when the finished product is actually the result of an extraordinary amount of effort by human editors. That would be like saying Merriam Webster wrote Eat, Pray, Love because all of the words in it came out of the dictionary and Elizabeth Gilbert just edited the story to help give it a better structure.  It gives people an incredibly inaccurate picture of what machine learning is capable of. <br><br>There are some things that modern AIs have gotten very, very good at. Like keeping eyes glued to a news feed or serving you the right ad at the right time. But these writing AIs work simply by predicting what the next word should be by looking at what word or words preceded it. Narrative and/or joke structures simply don&#39;t arise out an algorithm like that. Maybe some day someone will figure out how to get a bot to understand Dan Harmon&#39;s story wheel. But that day is still probably very far off in the future.| 0 0

I mean most of the jokes weren&#39;t even proper English. Whoever approved that at Netflix and released it should be fired. Maybe Netflix should next time use the money they invested in this for something useful like feeding homeless or creating a non profit. But that makes too much sense!! Have a great day everyone!

633 |Okay bear with me for a sec. So AI bots are typically trained over many "generations," through which they learn how to be more coherent and develop a better understanding of how things work. Kind of like how each generation of humans learns more about our reality.

Now this AI has reached a point where it was able to invent some genuinely funny jokes, even though it still seems to have a misguided understanding of various words and the structure of reality.

So whether you believe in God or a simulation or whatever, what if we as a species are just a project that's learning over many generations in order to provide entertainment or insight to some other entity? Just like this AI making up an absurd stand-up routine, maybe we're just here to be our flawed, confused, playful selves, and do cool shit for the amusement of reality itself.| 1 0

As a Florida resident, that is bullshit. 


It’s at least 3 alligators. But yes… the floor is not floor, it is alligator. That’s why the roads are so bad here, it’s just bumpy ass alligator with smaller alligators everywhere… and by “smaller” I mean smaller than the entire state, they’re still fucking huge. There was a literal dinosaur in the road the other day and we all just took pictures of it and one guy threw it some chicken nuggets and we went about our day… like we saw a stray dog or something. It wasn’t even worth mentioning, I literally told no one about the 15foot long prehistoric monster blocking traffic.

820 |I’m a bit skeptical that this was AI; it sounds more like a human impression of AI text generation. The ways in which it is good and bad are all backwards. The grammar is constantly off, which really isn’t an issue nowadays. AI generation usually results in perfectly grammatical sentences; they just don’t make semantic sense. There are also a ton of callback jokes, and AI text generation is notoriously bad at maintaining context over time. Each sentence naturally would lead into the next, but overall structure is often nonsensical, because it doesn’t maintain meaning or action-consequence. I really find it hard to believe that it would change topic, but then later come back to the certificate and flag jokes to make a callback.| 1 0

2686 |Calm down guys, they are just bad jokes. You could probably find them in an old 1950s joke book. But yes they are funny if your humor is broken to relate to a group of AI.

If you view this as a parody, I'd like to think that its a commentary on how simple minded comedy is to human convenient which is true and appreciate the effort.| 0 0

2869 |It makes it so much less funny when it becomes glaringly obvious that it was not actually an AI that wrote this. First, these type of neural networks are not taught with video feed like Netflix claims, they get raw stage directions fed to them as input in text form. Second, there's just too much cohesion between the parts. A real script output from an actual neural network would not be so self-referential - running jokes, like the death certificate one. Or even mentioning dentists more than once. Third, an AI doesn't just drop "a" and "the" articles before nouns for seemingly no reasons other than to make it sound funnier for us.

2922 |I'm not an AI expert or anything, but I know enough that I was able to cobble together a fanfiction-writing bot. And I can assure anyone reading this that if a bot really did "write" this set it was heavily edited by a human being to make anything resembling a stand-up routine - likely out of hundreds or thousands of pages of essentially drivel.  

Most of the sentences my bot crafted were correctly structured. Occasionally a small group of sentences would cluster around one concept. And it definitely produced some real gems. But there was A LOT of noise surrounding those gems. My goal was to use the stories as a premise for a podcast.  But to pull together a five minute short story even remotely worth listening to would have taken me heavily editing down hundreds of pages to just a few. And that just didn't feel right to me.

I think it's a real shame and super dishonest when people say a bot "wrote something" when the finished product is actually the result of an extraordinary amount of effort by human editors. That would be like saying Merriam Webster wrote Eat, Pray, Love because all of the words in it came out of the dictionary and Elizabeth Gilbert just edited the story to help give it a better structure.  It gives people an incredibly inaccurate picture of what machine learning is capable of. 

There are some things that modern AIs have gotten very, very good at. Like keeping eyes glued to a news feed or serving you the right ad at the right time. But these writing AIs work simply by predicting what the next word should be by looking at what word or words preceded it. Narrative and/or joke structures simply don't arise out an algorithm like that. Maybe some day someone will figure out how to get a bot to understand Dan Harmon's story wheel. But that day is still probably very far off in the future.| 1 1

3045 |Hmmm..I do wonder if it was actually written by an AI, or if it’s one of those ones that are pretending to be written by an AI.
(Edit.) Oh, so the guy who made this is the same guy who makes those scripts that say “I forced an AI to watch 100 of [insert thing here].” Apparently, most of those aren’t actually written by AI, so this one probably isn’t either, but regardless, it is funny, as are those, I think because of the concept of “this is this thing in a nutshell, but like, randomer, but also like, basically it! Kinda.” Or people just find humor that appears to be randomly generated funny. I know I do.| 0 1

4427 |Watch that bot written stand up then immediately go watch a Dave Chappelle clip... Or Bill Burr.... Or Joy Koy.... Or Louis CK. Basically go watch any real comedian and compare the two. 100 out of 100 people will laugh harder with the human comedian. This algorithm stand up is terrible. I mean most of the jokes weren't even proper English. Whoever approved that at Netflix and released it should be fired. Maybe Netflix should next time use the money they invested in this for something useful like feeding homeless or creating a non profit. But that makes too much sense!! Have a great day everyone! Life ROCKS if you want it to!! 

Go watch this Best of Joy Koy.... You're welcome!

633 |Okay bear with me for a sec. So AI bots are typically trained over many "generations," through which they learn how to be more coherent and develop a better understanding of how things work. Kind of like how each generation of humans learns more about our reality.

Now this AI has reached a point where it was able to invent some genuinely funny jokes, even though it still seems to have a misguided understanding of various words and the structure of reality.

So whether you believe in God or a simulation or whatever, what if we as a species are just a project that's learning over many generations in order to provide entertainment or insight to some other entity? Just like this AI making up an absurd stand-up routine, maybe we're just here to be our flawed, confused, playful selves, and do cool shit for the amusement of reality itself.| 1 0

As a Florida resident, that is bullshit. 


It’s at least 3 alligators. But yes… the floor is not floor, it is alligator. That’s why the roads are so bad here, it’s just bumpy ass alligator with smaller alligators everywhere… and by “smaller” I mean smaller than the entire state, they’re still fucking huge. There was a literal dinosaur in the road the other day and we all just took pictures of it and one guy threw it some chicken nuggets and we went about our day… like we saw a stray dog or something. It wasn’t even worth mentioning, I literally told no one about the 15foot long prehistoric monster blocking traffic.

820 |I’m a bit skeptical that this was AI; it sounds more like a human impression of AI text generation. The ways in which it is good and bad are all backwards. The grammar is constantly off, which really isn’t an issue nowadays. AI generation usually results in perfectly grammatical sentences; they just don’t make semantic sense. There are also a ton of callback jokes, and AI text generation is notoriously bad at maintaining context over time. Each sentence naturally would lead into the next, but overall structure is often nonsensical, because it doesn’t maintain meaning or action-consequence. I really find it hard to believe that it would change topic, but then later come back to the certificate and flag jokes to make a callback.| 1 0

1403 |I hope the people saying this is fake are wrong. My experience using ai dungeon makes me think it's definitely possible that an ai wrote this, because it sometimes spits out jokes like this and sometimes references things mentioned earlier, but it's also possible it is faked, but faking this sort of thing is just stupid. It stops being a good video if it is faked. I don't like this and I'm not amused by it if it is written by a human who is lying about writing it.| 0 0

2686 |Calm down guys, they are just bad jokes. You could probably find them in an old 1950s joke book. But yes they are funny if your humor is broken to relate to a group of AI.

If you view this as a parody, I'd like to think that its a commentary on how simple minded comedy is to human convenient which is true and appreciate the effort.| 0 0

2869 |It makes it so much less funny when it becomes glaringly obvious that it was not actually an AI that wrote this. First, these type of neural networks are not taught with video feed like Netflix claims, they get raw stage directions fed to them as input in text form. Second, there's just too much cohesion between the parts. A real script output from an actual neural network would not be so self-referential - running jokes, like the death certificate one. Or even mentioning dentists more than once. Third, an AI doesn't just drop "a" and "the" articles before nouns for seemingly no reasons other than to make it sound funnier for us.

2922 |I'm not an AI expert or anything, but I know enough that I was able to cobble together a fanfiction-writing bot. And I can assure anyone reading this that if a bot really did "write" this set it was heavily edited by a human being to make anything resembling a stand-up routine - likely out of hundreds or thousands of pages of essentially drivel.  

Most of the sentences my bot crafted were correctly structured. Occasionally a small group of sentences would cluster around one concept. And it definitely produced some real gems. But there was A LOT of noise surrounding those gems. My goal was to use the stories as a premise for a podcast.  But to pull together a five minute short story even remotely worth listening to would have taken me heavily editing down hundreds of pages to just a few. And that just didn't feel right to me.

I think it's a real shame and super dishonest when people say a bot "wrote something" when the finished product is actually the result of an extraordinary amount of effort by human editors. That would be like saying Merriam Webster wrote Eat, Pray, Love because all of the words in it came out of the dictionary and Elizabeth Gilbert just edited the story to help give it a better structure.  It gives people an incredibly inaccurate picture of what machine learning is capable of. 

There are some things that modern AIs have gotten very, very good at. Like keeping eyes glued to a news feed or serving you the right ad at the right time. But these writing AIs work simply by predicting what the next word should be by looking at what word or words preceded it. Narrative and/or joke structures simply don't arise out an algorithm like that. Maybe some day someone will figure out how to get a bot to understand Dan Harmon's story wheel. But that day is still probably very far off in the future.| 1 1

(Edit.) Oh, so the guy who made this is the same guy who makes those scripts that say “I forced an AI to watch 100 of [insert thing here].” Apparently, most of those aren’t actually written by AI, so this one probably isn’t either, but regardless, it is funny, as are those, I think because of the concept of “this is this thing in a nutshell, but like, randomer, but also like, basically it! Kinda.” Or people just find humor that appears to be randomly generated funny. I know I do.| 0 1

4427 |Watch that bot written stand up then immediately go watch a Dave Chappelle clip... Or Bill Burr.... Or Joy Koy.... Or Louis CK. Basically go watch any real comedian and compare the two. 100 out of 100 people will laugh harder with the human comedian. This algorithm stand up is terrible. I mean most of the jokes weren't even proper English. Whoever approved that at Netflix and released it should be fired. Maybe Netflix should next time use the money they invested in this for something useful like feeding homeless or creating a non profit. But that makes too much sense!! Have a great day everyone! Life ROCKS if you want it to!! 

Go watch this Best of Joy Koy.... You're welcome!

624 |This ‘entirely by bots’ series is so unexpectedly entertaining 😝| 1 0
633 |Okay bear with me for a sec. So AI bots are typically trained over many "generations," through which they learn how to be more coherent and develop a better understanding of how things work. Kind of like how each generation of humans learns more about our reality.

Now this AI has reached a point where it was able to invent some genuinely funny jokes, even though it still seems to have a misguided understanding of various words and the structure of reality.

So whether you believe in God or a simulation or whatever, what if we as a species are just a project that's learning over many generations in order to provide entertainment or insight to some other entity? Just like this AI making up an absurd stand-up routine, maybe we're just here to be our flawed, confused, playful selves, and do cool shit for the amusement of reality itself.| 1 0

820 |I’m a bit skeptical that this was AI; it sounds more like a human impression of AI text generation. The ways in which it is good and bad are all backwards. The grammar is constantly off, which really isn’t an issue nowadays. AI generation usually results in perfectly grammatical sentences; they just don’t make semantic sense. There are also a ton of callback jokes, and AI text generation is notoriously bad at maintaining context over time. Each sentence naturally would lead into the next, but overall structure is often nonsensical, because it doesn’t maintain meaning or action-consequence. I really find it hard to believe that it would change topic, but then later come back to the certificate and flag jokes to make a callback.| 1 0

2869 |It makes it so much less funny when it becomes glaringly obvious that it was not actually an AI that wrote this. First, these type of neural networks are not taught with video feed like Netflix claims, they get raw stage directions fed to them as input in text form. Second, there's just too much cohesion between the parts. A real script output from an actual neural network would not be so self-referential - running jokes, like the death certificate one. Or even mentioning dentists more than once. Third, an AI doesn't just drop "a" and "the" articles before nouns for seemingly no reasons other than to make it sound funnier for us.

2901 |This is clearly not actually written by a bot.| 0 1
2922 |I'm not an AI expert or anything, but I know enough that I was able to cobble together a fanfiction-writing bot. And I can assure anyone reading this that if a bot really did "write" this set it was heavily edited by a human being to make anything resembling a stand-up routine - likely out of hundreds or thousands of pages of essentially drivel.  

Most of the sentences my bot crafted were correctly structured. Occasionally a small group of sentences would cluster around one concept. And it definitely produced some real gems. But there was A LOT of noise surrounding those gems. My goal was to use the stories as a premise for a podcast.  But to pull together a five minute short story even remotely worth listening to would have taken me heavily editing down hundreds of pages to just a few. And that just didn't feel right to me.

I think it's a real shame and super dishonest when people say a bot "wrote something" when the finished product is actually the result of an extraordinary amount of effort by human editors. That would be like saying Merriam Webster wrote Eat, Pray, Love because all of the words in it came out of the dictionary and Elizabeth Gilbert just edited the story to help give it a better structure.  It gives people an incredibly inaccurate picture of what machine learning is capable of. 

There are some things that modern AIs have gotten very, very good at. Like keeping eyes glued to a news feed or serving you the right ad at the right time. But these writing AIs work simply by predicting what the next word should be by looking at what word or words preceded it. Narrative and/or joke structures simply don't arise out an algorithm like that. Maybe some day someone will figure out how to get a bot to understand Dan Harmon's story wheel. But that day is still probably very far off in the future.| 1 1

(Edit.) Oh, so the guy who made this is the same guy who makes those scripts that say “I forced an AI to watch 100 of [insert thing here].” Apparently, most of those aren’t actually written by AI, so this one probably isn’t either, but regardless, it is funny, as are those, I think because of the concept of “this is this thing in a nutshell, but like, randomer, but also like, basically it! Kinda.” Or people just find humor that appears to be randomly generated funny. I know I do.| 0 1

624 |This ‘entirely by bots’ series is so unexpectedly entertaining 😝| 1 0
633 |Okay bear with me for a sec. So AI bots are typically trained over many "generations," through which they learn how to be more coherent and develop a better understanding of how things work. Kind of like how each generation of humans learns more about our reality.

Now this AI has reached a point where it was able to invent some genuinely funny jokes, even though it still seems to have a misguided understanding of various words and the structure of reality.

So whether you believe in God or a simulation or whatever, what if we as a species are just a project that's learning over many generations in order to provide entertainment or insight to some other entity? Just like this AI making up an absurd stand-up routine, maybe we're just here to be our flawed, confused, playful selves, and do cool shit for the amusement of reality itself.| 1 0

813 |There were actually a couple of half decent jokes| 0 1
820 |I’m a bit skeptical that this was AI; it sounds more like a human impression of AI text generation. The ways in which it is good and bad are all backwards. The grammar is constantly off, which really isn’t an issue nowadays. AI generation usually results in perfectly grammatical sentences; they just don’t make semantic sense. There are also a ton of callback jokes, and AI text generation is notoriously bad at maintaining context over time. Each sentence naturally would lead into the next, but overall structure is often nonsensical, because it doesn’t maintain meaning or action-consequence. I really find it hard to believe that it would change topic, but then later come back to the certificate and flag jokes to make a callback.| 1 0

2869 |It makes it so much less funny when it becomes glaringly obvious that it was not actually an AI that wrote this. First, these type of neural networks are not taught with video feed like Netflix claims, they get raw stage directions fed to them as input in text form. Second, there's just too much cohesion between the parts. A real script output from an actual neural network would not be so self-referential - running jokes, like the death certificate one. Or even mentioning dentists more than once. Third, an AI doesn't just drop "a" and "the" articles before nouns for seemingly no reasons other than to make it sound funnier for us.

And I can assure anyone reading this that if a bot really did "write" this set it was heavily edited by a human being to make anything resembling a stand-up routine - likely out of hundreds or thousands of pages of essentially drivel.  

Most of the sentences my bot crafted were correctly structured. Occasionally a small group of sentences would cluster around one concept. And it definitely produced some real gems. But there was A LOT of noise surrounding those gems. My goal was to use the stories as a premise for a podcast.  But to pull together a five minute short story even remotely worth listening to would have taken me heavily editing down hundreds of pages to just a few. And that just didn't feel right to me.

I think it's a real shame and super dishonest when people say a bot "wrote something" when the finished product is actually the result of an extraordinary amount of effort by human editors. That would be like saying Merriam Webster wrote Eat, Pray, Love because all of the words in it came out of the dictionary and Elizabeth Gilbert just edited the story to help give it a better structure.  It gives people an incredibly inaccurate picture of what machine learning is capable of. 

There are some things that modern AIs have gotten very, very good at. Like keeping eyes glued to a news feed or serving you the right ad at the right time. But these writing AIs work simply by predicting what the next word should be by looking at what word or words preceded it. Narrative and/or joke structures simply don't arise out an algorithm like that. Maybe some day someone will figure out how to get a bot to understand Dan Harmon's story wheel. But that day is still probably very far off in the future.| 1 1

3045 |Hmmm..I do wonder if it was actually written by an AI, or if it’s one of those ones that are pretending to be written by an AI.
(Edit.) Oh, so the guy who made this is the same guy who makes those scripts that say “I forced an AI to watch 100 of [insert thing here].” Apparently, most of those aren’t actually written by AI, so this one probably isn’t either, but regardless, it is funny, as are those, I think because of the concept of “this is this thing in a nutshell, but like, randomer, but also like, basically it! Kinda.” Or people just find humor that appears to be randomly generated funny. I know I do.| 0 1

624 |This ‘entirely by bots’ series is so unexpectedly entertaining 😝| 1 0
633 |Okay bear with me for a sec. So AI bots are typically trained over many "generations," through which they learn how to be more coherent and develop a better understanding of how things work. Kind of like how each generation of humans learns more about our reality.

Now this AI has reached a point where it was able to invent some genuinely funny jokes, even though it still seems to have a misguided understanding of various words and the structure of reality.

So whether you believe in God or a simulation or whatever, what if we as a species are just a project that's learning over many generations in order to provide entertainment or insight to some other entity? Just like this AI making up an absurd stand-up routine, maybe we're just here to be our flawed, confused, playful selves, and do cool shit for the amusement of reality itself.| 1 0

820 |I’m a bit skeptical that this was AI; it sounds more like a human impression of AI text generation. The ways in which it is good and bad are all backwards. The grammar is constantly off, which really isn’t an issue nowadays. AI generation usually results in perfectly grammatical sentences; they just don’t make semantic sense. There are also a ton of callback jokes, and AI text generation is notoriously bad at maintaining context over time. Each sentence naturally would lead into the next, but overall structure is often nonsensical, because it doesn’t maintain meaning or action-consequence. I really find it hard to believe that it would change topic, but then later come back to the certificate and flag jokes to make a callback.| 1 0

2359 |This is probably not 100% bot-written. There's lateral thinking, callbacks, and other nuances a bot wouldn't be capable of, at least not by regurgitating bits and pieces of comedy scripts.

2869 |It makes it so much less funny when it becomes glaringly obvious that it was not actually an AI that wrote this. First, these type of neural networks are not taught with video feed like Netflix claims, they get raw stage directions fed to them as input in text form. Second, there's just too much cohesion between the parts. A real script output from an actual neural network would not be so self-referential - running jokes, like the death certificate one. Or even mentioning dentists more than once. Third, an AI doesn't just drop "a" and "the" articles before nouns for seemingly no reasons other than to make it sound funnier for us. Sorry for pissing on your bonfire.| 0 1

2901 |This is clearly not actually written by a bot.| 0 1
2922 |I'm not an AI expert or anything, but I know enough that I was able to cobble together a fanfiction-writing bot. And I can assure anyone reading this that if a bot really did "write" this set it was heavily edited by a human being to make anything resembling a stand-up routine - likely out of hundreds or thousands of pages of essentially drivel.  

Most of the sentences my bot crafted were correctly structured. Occasionally a small group of sentences would cluster around one concept. And it definitely produced some real gems. But there was A LOT of noise surrounding those gems. My goal was to use the stories as a premise for a podcast.  But to pull together a five minute short story even remotely worth listening to would have taken me heavily editing down hundreds of pages to just a few. And that just didn't feel right to me.

I think it's a real shame and super dishonest when people say a bot "wrote something" when the finished product is actually the result of an extraordinary amount of effort by human editors. That would be like saying Merriam Webster wrote Eat, Pray, Love because all of the words in it came out of the dictionary and Elizabeth Gilbert just edited the story to help give it a better structure.  It gives people an incredibly inaccurate picture of what machine learning is capable of. 

There are some things that modern AIs have gotten very, very good at. Like keeping eyes glued to a news feed or serving you the right ad at the right time. But these writing AIs work simply by predicting what the next word should be by looking at what word or words preceded it. Narrative and/or joke structures simply don't arise out an algorithm like that. Maybe some day someone will figure out how to get a bot to understand Dan Harmon's story wheel. But that day is still probably very far off in the future.| 1 1
2925 |This is hilarious but it’s kinda scary how bots can make an actually funny piece of comedy| 0 1

3045 |Hmmm..I do wonder if it was actually written by an AI, or if it’s one of those ones that are pretending to be written by an AI.
(Edit.) Oh, so the guy who made this is the same guy who makes those scripts that say “I forced an AI to watch 100 of [insert thing here].” Apparently, most of those aren’t actually written by AI, so this one probably isn’t either, but regardless, it is funny, as are those, I think because of the concept of “this is this thing in a nutshell, but like, randomer, but also like, basically it! Kinda.” Or people just find humor that appears to be randomly generated funny. I know I do.| 0 1
