432 |"Dinosaurs are crazy weird, right? How did they survive without having credit cards?..... I guess they didn't!" This actually makes complete sense grammatically, and historically. It plays a commentary on how people can't seem to live without credit. This joke is so accurate that it kinda scares me to know that an AI came up with it.| 1 0

781 |‚ÄúFlorida is an alligator people live on..‚Äù
As a Florida resident, that is bullshit. 


It‚Äôs at least 3 alligators. But yes‚Ä¶ the floor is not floor, it is alligator. That‚Äôs why the roads are so bad here, it‚Äôs just bumpy ass alligator with smaller alligators everywhere‚Ä¶ and by ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù I mean smaller than the entire state, they‚Äôre still fucking huge. There was a literal dinosaur in the road the other day and we all just took pictures of it and one guy threw it some chicken nuggets and we went about our day‚Ä¶ like we saw a stray dog or something. It wasn‚Äôt even worth mentioning, I literally told no one about the 15foot long prehistoric monster blocking traffic. Because everyone I know lives in Florida and it probably happened to them too.| 0 1

2868 |That dinosaur joke was actually really good| 1 0
2869 |It makes it so much less funny when it becomes glaringly obvious that it was not actually an AI that wrote this. First, these type of neural networks are not taught with video feed like Netflix claims, they get raw stage directions fed to them as input in text form. Second, there's just too much cohesion between the parts. A real script output from an actual neural network would not be so self-referential - running jokes, like the death certificate one. Or even mentioning dentists more than once. Third, an AI doesn't just drop "a" and "the" articles before nouns for seemingly no reasons other than to make it sound funnier for us. Sorry for pissing on your bonfire.| 1 0

2901 |This is clearly not actually written by a bot.| 1 0
2922 |I'm not an AI expert or anything, but I know enough that I was able to cobble together a fanfiction-writing bot. And I can assure anyone reading this that if a bot really did "write" this set it was heavily edited by a human being to make anything resembling a stand-up routine - likely out of hundreds or thousands of pages of essentially drivel.  

Most of the sentences my bot crafted were correctly structured. Occasionally a small group of sentences would cluster around one concept. And it definitely produced some real gems. But there was A LOT of noise surrounding those gems. My goal was to use the stories as a premise for a podcast.  But to pull together a five minute short story even remotely worth listening to would have taken me heavily editing down hundreds of pages to just a few. And that just didn't feel right to me.

I think it's a real shame and super dishonest when people say a bot "wrote something" when the finished product is actually the result of an extraordinary amount of effort by human editors. That would be like saying Merriam Webster wrote Eat, Pray, Love because all of the words in it came out of the dictionary and Elizabeth Gilbert just edited the story to help give it a better structure.  It gives people an incredibly inaccurate picture of what machine learning is capable of. 

There are some things that modern AIs have gotten very, very good at. Like keeping eyes glued to a news feed or serving you the right ad at the right time. But these writing AIs work simply by predicting what the next word should be by looking at what word or words preceded it. Narrative and/or joke structures simply don't arise out an algorithm like that. Maybe some day someone will figure out how to get a bot to understand Dan Harmon's story wheel. But that day is still probably very far off in the future.| 1 0

3045 |Hmmm..I do wonder if it was actually written by an AI, or if it‚Äôs one of those ones that are pretending to be written by an AI.
(Edit.) Oh, so the guy who made this is the same guy who makes those scripts that say ‚ÄúI forced an AI to watch 100 of [insert thing here].‚Äù Apparently, most of those aren‚Äôt actually written by AI, so this one probably isn‚Äôt either, but regardless, it is funny, as are those, I think because of the concept of ‚Äúthis is this thing in a nutshell, but like, randomer, but also like, basically it! Kinda.‚Äù Or people just find humor that appears to be randomly generated funny. I know I do.| 1 0

3862 |jesus, this is so good I'm seriously having doubts its actually written by an AI.
